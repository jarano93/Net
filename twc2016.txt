I'll spend the next hundred years trying to write you another love song
That you can throw in my face, rip up, and shove in my eyes
You've got me caught in your web like a fly with its insides turned to acid
So please oh please just let me die

I keep explaining away the tears I cry in the morning
And you love the fact I can't go on this way
You've forgotten my face as soon as I turn around
And I can not stand another day

I've gone mad and a half listening to your whisperings and your wantings
I've been praying for the day you come home with somebody new
The dreams we plant in the spring you know won't make it to summer
So who is to blame when you break my heart in two

Why did I let my song go on and on and on you were always gone
I would give everything in all my dreams to you to start anew
Take me back to that passing dream where I'm gonna be just fine
Take me back to that passing dream where I'm gonna be just fine

Simplicity strikes again
Can I still call it love if its the easy option

Simplicity strikes again
Dictating my choice by removing my options
I'd like to think that I fought it
I'd like to think that I still can

Aren't I just a pawn
Who doesn't need or want to know what its going to do
And that suits me just fine
Oh that suits me just fine

Fate
Don't tell
Fate 
Don't Tell

Jealousy strikes again
Who did it hit first is the real question
It must have been the bigger target
So they ought to be the bigger man

Is rage all I am
Or what will I be when you take that too
Its a secondary emotion
I'm the tertiary man

Fate 
Don't Tell
Fate
Don't Tell
Me what to do

Cigarette lights
Waste my day
I drink cold black coffee 
From yesterday
A ray of sunshine tries to burn this fog away
I said good morning as a goodbye today

I can remember 
The last song you sang
I can't seem to forget 
The phone when it rang
I thought your goodbyes were supposed to bring pain
But all it carried was nothing

So I'll sing loud and often
I'll sing me to sleep
I don't need a love song
I don't need to dream

I'm dreaming of the rainfall
While sitting in sun
I run my list of regrets 
Things can't be undone
If I found someone to love me I would run run run
Failures easy if divided by one

So fill up my drink
Pour me some wine
This rum inspired daydream
Is something worth my time
A song that means silence and words that don't rhyme
It's all yours when you come back

So I'll sing loud and often
I'll sing you to sleep
I don't need a love song
I don't need to dream

I'll sing loud and often
I'll sing me to sleep 
I don't need a love song
I don't need to dream
I don't need to dream
I don't need to dream

When I was young I had a pink eraser
I would try to erase my skin 
Like scratched mistakes on 
Recycled wide ruled paper

I still don't get how I was such a burden
I always tried to keep my head down
But somehow my silence and my smile
Got me into trouble

Who cares how beautiful I think I am
I don't need to pretty up my label
How can I fight what I don't understand
Without making trouble

A fair skinned trophy you can take home to mama
An exotic toy you can show your friends 
I don't need to practice my response to
What are you

Is my soul so deniable that you'd strip me down to colors
And whitewash everything with which you don't agree
How dare you measure my worth by comparing me to you

Who cares how beautiful I think I am 
I don't need to pretty up my label
Why do I fight what I don't understand
Without making trouble
So I'll make trouble
So I'll make trouble

Why do you think it's up to you to measure my worth

How dare you dictate my life in comparison to you

Shooting up churches is trouble

As I grew up I was able to name it
And sure that helped me to sleep at night
But talking to myself 
Never breaks the silence
