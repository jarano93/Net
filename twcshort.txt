I’ll spend the next hundred years trying to write you another love song
That you can throw in my face, rip up, and shove in my eyes
You’ve got me caught in your web like a fly with its insides turned to acid
So please oh please just let me die

I keep explaining away the tears I cry in the morning
And you love the fact I can’t go on this way
You’ve forgotten my face as soon as I turn around
And I can not stand another day

I’ve gone mad and a half listening to your whisperings and your wantings
I’ve been praying for the day you come home with somebody new
The dreams we plant in the spring you know won’t make it to summer
So who is to blame when you break my heart in two

Why did I let my song go on and on and on you were always gone
I would give everything in all my dreams to you to start anew
Take me back to that passing dream where I’m gonna be just fine
Take me back to that passing dream where I’m gonna be just fine

Why does every song have to change the world
Or be cut down by the watching eye
Can’t I just say that i love a girl
And not make my audience cry
