I’ll spend the next hundred years trying to write you another love song
That you can throw in my face, rip up, and shove in my eyes
You’ve got me caught in your web like a fly with its insides turned to acid
So please oh please just let me die

I keep explaining away the tears I cry in the morning
And you love the fact I can’t go on this way
You’ve forgotten my face as soon as I turn around
And I can not stand another day

I’ve gone mad and a half listening to your whisperings and your wantings
I’ve been praying for the day you come home with somebody new
The dreams we plant in the spring you know won’t make it to summer
So who is to blame when you break my heart in two

Why did I let my song go on and on and on you were always gone
I would give everything in all my dreams to you to start anew
Take me back to that passing dream where I’m gonna be just fine
Take me back to that passing dream where I’m gonna be just fine

Why does every song have to change the world
Or be cut down by the watching eye
Can’t I just say that i love a girl
And not make my audience cry 

I don’t want anyone to connect to me
Or catch themselves in my verse
I can’t stand to make history
I want to sing for better or worse

I’ll change the key to keep it interesting
I’ll even change my fill
I don’t know why you’re still listening 
Surely you’ve got better things to do

I don’t know what I want to say
But I’m sure I won’t say it right
Who listens to the verse anyway
When the tune is so catchy and bright

Isn’t this groove easy to dance to
You can bob your head jump up and down
You can sing along though nobody asked you
And make me feel like I’m upward bound

I’ll change the key to keep it interesting
I’ll even change my fill
I don’t know why you’re still listening 
Surely you’ve got better things to do

I’ll change the key to keep it interesting
I’ll even change my fill
I don’t know why you’re still listening 
Surely you’ve got better things to do
You’ve got to have better things to do
I’ve got to have better things to do
Surely you’ve got better things to do
Between the lines

Why do I want to find a reason 
To look for another place to hide
And listen to the wind cry
You sent me a letter
Listing every time I made you cry
I memorized your goodbye

I’m trying to find the love between the lines
That sad song that was lost in the night
Look into my eyes

I know I know you’re gone this time
I know I know I know I did you wrong
Won’t you listen to my song

I have lost some love before
Sometimes I’ve turned the other way
But I want you I want you to stay

I’m trying to find the love between the lines
Look into my eyes

I know I’m the reason daddy’s gone off cheating
I heard him talking on the phone
I’m wasted time in waiting, a child born for hating
Some are meant to be alone

Don’t talk about love it’s just for losers
Don’t talk about love it ain’t for me
And I don’t have the time to wait for you to see

I don’t have time to waste on another pretty face
I won’t answer when you call
There’s no way this is real when you tell me how to feel
Your sweet intentions mean nothing at all

Don’t talk about love it’s just for losers
Don’t talk about love it ain’t for me
And I don’t have the time to wait for you to see

I’m losing control
Was that your only goal
And did you want to know who I am
That's all I need to know

Don’t talk about love it’s just for losers
Don’t talk about love it ain’t for me
And I don’t have the time to wait for you to see

Eliza Eliza
You know I can't find
Another Eliza today
I'm lost I am found
I've been thrown all around
I know I can love you today

Please don't go my Eliza dear
The girl next door says things I want to hear
Stay Today Stay Today

When tomorrow is gone
I'll say so long
Oh please let me love you today
Tonight is too far
The world is too large
I promise to love you today

Please don't go my Eliza dear
The girl next door says things I want to hear
Stay Today Stay Today

Please don't go my Eliza dear
The girl next door says things I want to hear
Stay Today Stay Today
My Eliza Stay Today

For many years I've been a rolling stone, my darling
Like a gypsy I have roamed from place to place
Fortune never came for me, Lord, how happy I would be
Just to look again upon your smiling face

If I should wander back tonight would you be waiting?
Would your eyes be filled with love's own tender light?
Would your arms  you thrill to find me here?
Would you love me if I wandered back tonight?

When budding flowers lend their fragrance to the springtime
I recall the roses twining 'round your door
Fancy then I homeward stay as I seem to hear you say
That you love me as you did in days of yore

If I should wander back tonight would you be waiting?
Would your eyes be filled with love's own tender light?
Would your arms be empty, dear, would you thrill to find me here?
Would you love me if I wandered back tonight?

Last night I dreamed that you and I were back together
And I held your hand so gently in my own
I heard you say we'd never part as I pressed you to my heart
And I woke up again to find myself alone

If I should wander back tonight would you be waiting?
Would your eyes be filled with love's own tender tt4 I?

If I should wander back tonight would you be waiting?
Would your eyes be filled with love's own tender light?
Would your arms be empty, dear, would you thrill to find me near?
Would you love me if I wandered back tonight?
Oh, would you love me if I wandered back tonight?

Wipe those tears from your eyes
They’re starting to ruin your disguise
No one here wants to see you cry
No not I no surprise
Go on and say your goodbyes

Put your smile back on
It’s been gone too long
No one here did you wrong
Now you’re gone so’s the song
That came undone

But please don’t make me go
I promise to change in ways you don’t know
I know this can work
Whatever it is you won’t end up hurt
So stop and close that door
Put your head in my arms and my bag on the floor

It is far too late
The tears are on your face
The love has left without a trace
Let me be give me peace
let me sleep alone

settle down settle down
take it take it easy on me
I ain’t willing to lose but I’m willing to admit i was wrong
Cuz there’s only so much time in the day
And there’s only so much that i can say
Learn to listen Learn to listen Learn to Listen
yeah yeah 

there’s a picture in your mind of what you used to be
and the hunger of ambition is a wish that you won’t feed
and the hum of the highway is a distant sense of speed
you got your hammer and your chisel it feels like old technology

Cuz there’s only so much time in the day
And there’s only so much that i can say
Learn to listen Learn to listen Learn to Listen

weave your way out from the city 
fold yourself back in the hills 
find your church out in the meadow
and remember to be still
and just listen to the quiet
that wild rippling sound 
and you’ll find that you’re here 
yeah you’ll find that you’re now

Cuz there’s only so much time in the day
And there’s only so much that i can say
Learn to listen Learn to listen Learn to Listen

settle down settle down
take it take it easy on me

until this section is done
I said barkeep pour me another drink so I can shut the voice up that tells me what to think
No sir i won’t slow down today

I want to be like some silly string so i can rot away after I’ve had my fling
I’ll never love another

You are smiling again saying we could be friends and a little bit more with a little bit of sin
No thanks love I’ve walked that path before

The story’s about you but this scenes about me and the birds and the bees are saying marvelous things 
So baby don’t let me come closer

Another lover walks in
Just in time to hold my hand
Another lover walks in
How long till this one ends 
I couldn’t love her back then
Its ok no one thinks you can
Another lover walks in
Another lover walks in

Who who are you and how are you doing
I am stuck on you and your beautiful implications 

Bartender pour me another beer I know I know I know my true love is near
Some golden courage and I can say hello

There she is at the end of the bar with her pretty young smile and her eyes bright as stars 
I’ll love you if you want me to

I don’t know you don’t know you don’t know I don’t know we can say what we want but it doesn’t make it so so hold on to your inhibitions

So stop right now because I’m doing just fine and I  dont want to get you stuck in my mind
(break) I don’t know how to say what i don’t like about you

Another lover walks in
You can forget and live again
Another lover walks in
This time they’ll understand
I didn’t love her back then
Why do you try to start again
Another lover walks in
Another lover walks in

Who who are you and what are you doing
Go on and walk away and take my inspiration
Look to the sky you’ll find mistakes all around let me be another in this lover’s lost and found
I can’t stand to leave I’m an exception to the rule I am safe here I’m keeping it cool

Yeah I’m keeping it cool
(you’re in the love lost and found)

What’s a pretty girl like you doing running around
You better get the hell out before you’re underground
This ain’t no game there’s no time for play
It’s feeding time and you know what they say

We know what you’ve done and there’s nowhere to hide
So now you’ve gotta run
(This is the night life)

If it’s the night life that you’re looking for
Turn around now before you’re begging for more
Once you come in you can not decline 
And you will always be mine

Cuz I’ll know what you’ve done and I’ll know where you’ll hide
So now you’re on the run
(From the night life)

So say what you want to say 
And do what you want to do
When you know what you’ve done
And you don’t want to hide
You’re in the night life

Oh Allison
What’s it take to steal your mind So I can own you all the time
Oh Allison Oh Allison

Oh Allison Oh Allison

I can not See what you Do when I I know I know
You know not A thing a bout what I I know I know
You should not know what I know about you
You can’t see When it's just me But baby I can’t hear you either
Fever Takes hold when You’re away Yet it drives me deeper
To find some way to prove this love is true

Its everything you do when you’re alone with me
I can’t stand The way you Are making eyes at other guys
You know he won't love you he'll fill you with filth and lies
He’s not good for you like you are for me

Hey, has that guy left you alone?

No. He keeps calling my house… and I know it's him. He just waits for me to say something then hangs up.

Eww… that’s so creepy!

Yeah, and it’s gotten worse.

What happened?

I started getting letters. No return address or stamp. Nothing. Just my name typed on the envelope.

What’d they say?

They were poems about everything I had done each day. It was like somebody followed me around documenting my life in rhyming couplets.

Wait! So the letters came at night telling you everything you had done that day?

Yes! And every time I’d open a letter, my phone would ring.

Oh my god…

That’s not even the worst part. Do you remember that guy I went to lunch with?

Yes.

He was mugged! He described the guy who did it, and it’s the same guy that I see everywhere I go.

Jesus… Have you called the police?

Yeah, they keep telling me I have no evidence of any crime committed against me. I can’t get a restraining order and there wasn’t even the "if it happens again call us" speech from the cops. I don’t even know this freak’s name. He knows who I am, my phone number, and where I live. He watches me all day. He WATCHES me! All. Day. Long. He assaults my friends, follows me everywhere, and legally, I can’t do anything.

I hope he stops… Are you ok? 

No! I am not ok! This sick fuck is stalking me! I don’t feel safe anywhere I go! And I’m not! I’m not safe. He is always here, just out of sight, taking in my every breath… Let’s get going, ok? I don’t like staying in one place too long. Oh god..There he is...

I try to get my voice out over traffic lights and bars
While smelling sweet perfume and choking on a fat cigar
I know I’ll find my way around I just need the time
To sit and write some melodies for a song so fine

One Day
I’ll pay my rent on time
One day
You’ll know a song that’s mine
One day I’ll play a sold out show
When’s one day
Who knows

With the city as my audience I laced up my shoes
I stood upon that milk crate and tried to sing the blues
I don’t care about my harmonies and who cares about my rhyme 
When the change in that pickle tub is my bottom line

One Day
I’ll pay my rent on time
One day
You’ll know a song that’s mine
One day I’ll play a sold out show
When’s one day
Who knows

I’m going to quit that job now that I’m working with the best
Money is falling out my pockets folks are clinging to my vest
Is that too much to dream about to keep me standing strong
One day won’t you please come along

One Day
I’ll pay my rent on time
One day
You’ll know a song that’s mine
One day I’ll play a sold out show
When’s one day
Who knows

Settle down little child
Your day will come tomorrow
Yesterdays will come and go
Who knows what your future holds
So rest your weary head and settle down

There are monsters in this world out to get you
And people that want to do the same
Foul winds will keep blowing through
Its enough to drive anyone insane

But you sugar blossom are stronger
And you can chase away your pain
So don’t be alone a minute longer
I’ll love you again and again

Settle down little child
Your day will come tomorrow
Yesterdays will come and go
Who knows what your future holds
So rest your weary head and settle down

People like to talk on what they hate
They only feel good when words are flowing
They’ll try to make you feel second rate
Just know they’re overblowing

Oh there’s people in this world that love you
Some don’t even know your name
So sleep away those November blues 
And darling let me do the same

Settle down little child
Your day will come tomorrow
Yesterdays will come and go
Who knows what your future holds
So rest your weary head and settle down

Let me sing you the song of the sea
It goes like this, I know what it means
Its true
I like what it says about you

The ocean breeze is soft in my mind
Seashells whisper songs of old time
I know them all
The songs I'll sing to you

Whistlin in the wind tonight
The stars and the moon shine bright
A soft whispered tune all around
And you cant help but be consumed by the sound


The albatross is flying too close to the shore
Its still a surprise though I’ve seen it before
I wonder
Why its the same with you

Each day is new it’s moving so fast
The motions we went through are a thing of the past
Please tell me
Why I'll move on without you

Whistlin in the wind tonight
The stars and the moon shine bright
A soft whispered tune all around
And you cant help but be consumed by the sound

Sweet temptation 
Is all that I need
Your lips part, you turn my way
It's all that I need

I see your body’s making eyes at me 
and your name’s on my tongue like you want it to be
there’s no way this dance is free
don’t patronize my dreams
it must be you it must be the wine
but I don’t want no love part time
cuz whatever you are just isn’t mine
there is no love supreme

No! what to think what to feel for tonight is it real 
I don’t want to know I just don’t want to know

Am I sweet or am I meat
Am I last night’s treat?
you got me rotting in the kitchen just to share your seat
each time you look my way my heart skips a beat 
and in your eyes I see the tantalizing gleam of

Sweet Temptation 
Sweet Temptation
Sweet Temptation
Sweet Temptation

No! I gotta stay strong  gotta push you away
I have to stay me for another day

All I see is you all I need is you
I’m a fool craving you like I belong in a zoo
You know you can tell me what you want me to do
we’ll share this stool we’ll play it cool and give in to your

Sweet Temptation
Sweet Temptation
Sweet Temptation
It's all that I need

Oh your drink in my hand whispers closer get closer
my head and heart fight though my body has chose her
I know this in my core I should run for the door
but your veiled intent has got me begging for more

My girl said she had no doubt
Asked if I’d stay by her side
Or else she’d walk straight on out
So I left the door open wide

If you find roses on my grave
I’m afraid there’s been a mistake
Throw ‘em out, throw ‘em out, throw ‘em out
They’re for the fella next door

Buddy and I met to drink
But buddy went a beer too far
He thought he could tell me what to think
So I crashed my buddy’s car

My sister begged me to spare a dime
My brother asked me to lend a bed
I threw down the phone, cut the line
And ran on out instead    

The lovers walked out to the water
Holding fresh flowers and cheap wine
Her heart could not wait any longer
She said I’ll be yours, won’t you be mine

So choose wisely your devils and saints
Cause they’re all from the same place
Typhoid and swans, lovers and guns
They’re all from the same place

He told her it’s too late for her
Let the truth be told
This morning he woke with another
So she dragged him to the ocean floor below

So choose wisely your devils and saints
Cause they’re all from the same place
Typhoid and swans, lovers and guns
They’re all from the same place

Who Let you in
My heart is breaking before we begin
Please spare me your grin
And save me the time before it ends
I've got nothing to say

Who let you through the door
Memories mean nothing with my heart out on the floor
You say you've been hurt before
As if that phrase will make me yours

I've got nothing to say
You can't have nothing to say
I won't have nothing to say

Who let you in
Took my old soul to the cleaners not a penny crossed your hand
Who let you in 
And what are you doing making me love again
