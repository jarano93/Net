So, I finish ff_seq with all the activations, gate states, cell states, and
output as an ND array

outputs and cell states are 1 longer than everything else because I need to look
back (during both FF & BPTT also)

the t-th output of the lstm gets compared during bptt directly with the t-th
sequence since a zero vector gets fed first into the lstm, and then after that
the sequence gets fed in

during BPTT I want to do as I wrote out on the loose leaf paper.
Start at the end of the sequence(T-th), and go back to the 0-th (first elem)

since cell state & hidden outputs are 1 longer than all other sequences go from
the T+1-th elem to the second elem( 1st)

I do NOT need to store the deltas in a np.array((seq_len, data_len))
Use additive assignment instead breh
